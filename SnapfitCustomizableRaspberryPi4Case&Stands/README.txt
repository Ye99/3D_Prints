files/YeZhangPicks

If you want to customize: use the scad files under Customerzer folder
1. use Case_Buttom_Color1.scad. Default paramters are good. 
2. Case_Top_Color1.scad. Defualt parameters are good (I have changed source code for my favorites).

Other preconfigured STL under files folder
1. Bottom_Slots_SM.stl
2. (no gpio 40 pins/camera/display holes) Top_H20_Slots_SM_Fan40_Screws.stl
